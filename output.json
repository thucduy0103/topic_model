        "content":"This fan (2020 New Box Fan) definitely sucks. The weakness of this fan is appalling. The “high” setting is about as powerful as an old man breathing on you. The “Low” setting might as well just be “off.” Whoever made this fan did a great job of making something that looks like a fan, but that’s the nicest thing you can say about It. The little fan above your seat on an airplane is probably about 10 times stronger than this fan."

        "content":"Look, I just needed to replace a box fan that died, and I needed to do it before summer hits again. This one is prettier than the one I had, had fair reviews, apparently moves air. I'm not picky. It turns out that this mf can cause a wind tunnel in an apartment on anything but the lowest setting, and I'm all for that because I'm menopausal and this will kill a hot flash so fast you almost didn't notice it. This is a great fan if you like wind. It's a little noisy but that's what happens when a thing moves a lot of air at a high speed - it's physics, kids"

        "content":"I have a small bedroom and a light summer duvet. It gets really hot here some nights in the summer, so I’ve been putting this fan next to my bed. Granted, it’s better than no fan, but for how loud this thing is, you’d think I’d at least be cool enough to be comfortable at night. I’m still sweating and I hate this fan."

        "content":"This review is for Pelonis PFB50a2abb-v box fan. Many of the other reviews and questions are about fans that tilt, oscillate, open for cleaning and so forth. Therefore, you cannot base a purchase decision on those reviews or star ratings. I bought two of these and will be returning both. They are extremely loud. Even on low speed they are much too loud to be used in a bedroom."

        "content":"Since childhood I've always had to sleep with a fan on. Can't go to sleep without one, and the white-noise apps playing through my stereo just ain't the same. So when my fan burnt out (I go through a box fan about once a year due to heavy use), I got this one through Amazon because of its cheap price and reviews. If you're into drowning out ambient noise, or just need the sound of rushing air look no further. This thing has a very pronounced air acoustic. So much so I never turn it above the low setting. Anything above that and it's....dang! I swear the thing is gonna take off and start flying around the room. The Wife can be vacuuming while I'm sleeping and I won't know it."
