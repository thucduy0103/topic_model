    "content": "This fan (2020 New Box Fan) definitely sucks. The weakness of this fan is appalling. The “high” setting is about as powerful as an old man breathing on you. The “Low” setting might as well just be “off.” Whoever made this fan did a great job of making something that looks like a fan, but that’s the nicest thing you can say about It. The little fan above your seat on an airplane is probably about 10 times stronger than this fan."

    "content": "Look, I just needed to replace a box fan that died, and I needed to do it before summer hits again. This one is prettier than the one I had, had fair reviews, apparently moves air. I'm not picky. It turns out that this mf can cause a wind tunnel in an apartment on anything but the lowest setting, and I'm all for that because I'm menopausal and this will kill a hot flash so fast you almost didn't notice it. This is a great fan if you like wind. It's a little noisy but that's what happens when a thing moves a lot of air at a high speed - it's physics, kids"

Granted, it’s better than no fan, but for how loud this thing is, you’d think I’d at least be cool enough to be comfortable at night. I’m still sweating and I hate this fan."

Therefore, you cannot base a purchase decision on those reviews or star ratings. I bought two of these and will be returning both. They are extremely loud. Even on low speed they are much too loud to be used in a bedroom."

    "content": "Since childhood I've always had to sleep with a fan on. Can't go to sleep without one, and the white-noise apps playing through my stereo just ain't the same. So when my fan burnt out (I go through a box fan about once a year due to heavy use), I got this one through Amazon because of its cheap price and reviews. If you're into drowning out ambient noise, or just need the sound of rushing air look no further. This thing has a very pronounced air acoustic. So much so I never turn it above the low setting. Anything above that and it's....dang! I swear the thing is gonna take off and start flying around the room. The Wife can be vacuuming while I'm sleeping and I won't know it."

  {
    "content": "People might think I'm odd, but I got this fan solely for the noise. Yes, for the noise it generates, and it does just that. So if your looking for a powerful, but quite fan, look elsewhere. This fan is not for you. I sleep with a fan on. The noise from the constant rotation of the motor and blades helps me sleep. But, it is a strong box fan and can reduce the temperature of a room by a bit. Sometimes I wake up cold. Even in the summer. And thats without the central air unit running through the night or any windows open to allow the cool night air in. So it is a strong fan and can be used for cooling rooms, but it is loud. It has 3 speed settings which is typical for almost any fan. The fan itself seems sturdy and well made. From the casing around the blades and motor, to the mesh face (solid plastic) and legs. Not like the last fan that I had before the motor blew up in it. You can almost place this fan on any surface (that isn't inclined) and it will stay unless, something was to knock it over. And even then, whatever was to knock it over would have to be fairly strong. I've bumped into it several times, and it barely wobbled. It's completely black, which I also love, and it has a sleek look. It's lightweight as well. Lighter than the last fan I had. It was made by Lasko. To sum it up, if your looking for a sturdy fan that can take the edge off from the heat, but don't mind the noise, than get it."

  {
    "content": "It moves air just like you would expect. A fan is a fan is a fan. I like that it can be adjusted to blow at different angles. However, the fan is also INCREDIBLY loud even on the lowest setting. Like many people I am working from home during the pandemic, and part of my job is to speak to customers on the phone. I am unable to hear customers because this fan is so loud (I have it set up around 8 ft away in my hallway blowing from the bedroom into the living room). Customers have asked me if I was in the car wash. They were able to hear the fan even over the phone. I like the functionality but due to excessive noise levels I will be returning this."

I can clearly hear both my upstairs and downstairs neighbors, the former of which have two chihuahuas and an active ‘romantic’ life, and the latter of which works on wordworking projects late into the night. Renting is a nightmare. So, I specifically searched for box fans with reviews that mentioned the noise level. This fan does the trick- all three settings are excellent white noise, with the highest setting bordering on deafening. If you can comfortably sleep with white noise, this is well worth the price."

My room gets hot a lot and this doesn't help other then blow air directly to you to stay cool. I had this on the table. Its flat doesn't make things fall but after putting this fan there and falls off. Already scratches on it like cheaply made. It even feels cheap. I can't think of keeping this might have to return it and buy a different one thats better price. I will say I told mom to get this since we were looking for a good price big fan and boy I was mistaken for buying this. My mother final decision to return it or not but I'll say we should get something better for the price."

I do not trust and will never trust gas as a source of heat for my home with my birds. Baseboard heating would be financially crazy high and it dries the air to the point my FIDS getting itchy and plucky therefore I got creative until I can afford true radiant heating. A fan behind an oil filled heater is not only economical but very toasty and warm environment. THIS FAN IS FANTASTIC; it is not to big and not to small; it is quit and the white noise from the fan is relaxing but not over powering. I will also be using this fan in the summer. By far this is the best fan I have purchased in recent years and I plan on buying 2 more to use in my 2 bird rooms to help keep my FIDS stay cool in the summer so to speak in bird terms, to clarify, birds do not sweat or have saliva therefore the moving air from the fan helps them tolerate hot hot weather. Lastly, this fan is good enough to be around my FIDS and that is the ultimate for me."

The fan is noisy on the highest fan speed and quiet on the lower settings as all fans are but me and my bunnies enjoy it and it keeps the room nice and comfortable and my ac isn't running all the time which saves me money on my electric bill. I highly recommend this fan. I bought two and I use them everyday and plan to purchase at least one more."

I live in a older house 2 story and my sons room gets so hot even with a air conditioner in our room ( joining rooms, hes a toddler). We bought this fan to try and help the air flow and boy does it suckkk. When I originally turned it on, it started on 3 and barely blew anything. I thought it was a joke and the knob was messed up but as I scan threw it got weaker and weaker.. I stupidly didnt return in time frame and over time this gets worse. Blows less. It's already needs cleaned too. I just reccomend saving your money and going to a local walmart and buying a box fan from their. Cheaper and work better."

    "content": "Why don’t they make decent fans any more? I got this to sleep. First of all, the noise level of this fan is absurd. This is in no way good for people who like “white noise” when they sleep. Has 3 power settings. Noise wise, setting one is just barely acceptable for me, for overall noise. Settings 2 and 3 are like jet engines. And not loud with a low level or soothing hum. It’s a higher pitched sound and isn’t consistent (goes in and out). People who sleep with fans will know what I mean by this. As far as air flow, you’re really not getting much even on the highest setting, especially with the noise level taken into consideration. Compared to something like the wind machine, which was my go-to fan for many years, unless they also dropped the quality on these machines. Very tired and frustrated with this."

I used my ohm meter to check continuity at the plug. OK, but the fan was still a DEAD PIECE OF JUNK!"

I have never been more disappointed in a purchase. Please, do not waste your hard earned money on this item. In my opinion, you will only be as disappointed as I am."

When I am in my kitchen apartment, anyone in the hallway can hear my conversations but not anymore when this fan is on. It takes over as background white noise and I love it. Thank you. I bought this fan to make a DIY air purifier and the air movement is good on level 1. I bought a furnace Merv filter and due to the air suction it sticks to the back of the fan even when it is on level 1. I had bought a brand air purifier (I will leave unnamed) for $196.00 and there was no air flow and after one hour it smelled like it was burning so I return this amazon purchase by the option of dropping off via Kohl's and then I bought this fan and the Merv filter for a total of $90.00. Such better air flow for purifying the air and for less than half the price with no burning smell. I only leave this fan with the MERV filter on for an hour at a time to avoid burning out the motor for the fan."

If you are looking for a fan to keep you asleep, this is the one. VERY PLEASANT noise. People nowadays don't just by fans for cooling but for noise blocking and white noise to sleep or read with. This one does BOTH. Best fan I have ever owned. My dog (sleeps in my bed) is TERRIFIED of thunderstorms and this really helps. If on the floor, it provides vibration for her and on high it almost hides the thunderous booms! It has been a lifesaver for her."

I expect a low setting to gently move the air. (Sometimes that's all you need.) So, I got a fan speed controller (ACTIVE AIR ACSC Duct Speed Adjuster Fan Controler) which allows me to lower the fan speed (by lowering the power to the fan). So much quieter, and oftentimes this is just the right amount of circulation."

Probably wouldn't purchase this product again."

There is no way to unscrew the screen so I had to use a long screwdriver and stick duck tape on the loose piece and try to get it away from the blade so it wouldn’t make that horrible noise. Not fun...I would recommend getting a box fan that u can unscrew the panel if u needed to and I do not recommend this fan."

    "content": "Gets the job done, but it's noisier than my other box fan of the same size, even at its lowest speed.

So use with caution around flammables vapors and the like."

These are not as noisy on low, but I am sure that if I were to set it on medium or high, the noise level would be bothersome. They move the air very well (even on low) and that is what I wanted. After awhile I don't even hear it, but of course, every one is different regarding noise levels."

Several reviewers complained about both the cost (it's actually less expensive than most others available) and the sound. As to the sound, whoever reads these to use in their decisions, should bear in mind that these fans spin really fast, and have three speeds going faster than really fast! But this fan is lightweight, well-made, and a good value at it's price."

    "content": "About the same noise/ air at level one to a typical cheap box fan but a lot lighter. The way the feet work make it slightly wider than a typical box fan though. More stable overall then. At higher settings its get louder than a typical box fan both in pitch and measured dBA from about 18 from the side of it. Flow was visually checked with a Kleenex tissue, but I suspect a good box fan with wider fins would move a lot more air. My old $20 box fan seemed to be about it's equal."

If I bought another and took the back guard off one and the front off the other, then duct tape the two together, It might blow enough air. It's lightweight, so throwing it in the dump will be a breeze. The cardboard box it came in weighs almost as much as the fan itself."

    "content": "It's perfect for the money and almost exactly what I needed but on medium it's loud. On high, it sounds like an airplane. The output is not much but I think that since its made to fit in windows, it's slim and so are the blades, hence relatively slowish breeze. Very lightweight which is great. It's not very sturdy but since I'm not going to drive over it or beat it with a hammer, I don't think that'll be an issue. If you like airplanes and airboats, you'll love this fan."

When in the same room, we have to turn up the television really loud just to hear. If not for the fact we really needed to use the fan when it arrived, we would have returned it. This is the second fan from Pelonis that is really loud like this. We thought the first fan purchased last year must have been a fluke. We will not purchase another."

    "content": "It's a decent fan but doesn't move that much air. I bought a smaller high powered fan for $50 that is amazing. I'll be replacing this one with that. It might be good if you want a light breeze in your home but for outside use it's not that great."
  },
  {
    "content": "It's a fan. It makes fan noises, and pushes air around like a fan should. It's good for background white noise. I've been running it non-stop since I purchased it back in November of 2021 and it hasn't died on me yet. The Lasco I had before lasted me 3 years while running pretty much non-stop. If this one manages to take my abuse and lasts just as long, it'll be money well spent. I guess I shall see."
  },
  {
    "content": "It’s pretty lightweight and the highest setting is EXTREMELY loud and intense. I had it on the lowest setting only and it was almost too intense. It’s also quite noisy, when I would be on zoom meetings it was hard to hear when it was on. Good for the price, but not quiet."
  },
  {
    "content": "I’m not gonna lie, this thing is loud like any box fan. It could certainly be much louder from hearing other box fans. It has been a life saver though it cools the room so well. I live in an overheated 4th floor nyc apartment, it was so hot in my room. Put this in front of my open window and it made a huge difference. Would recommend, does the job!"
  },
  {
    "content": "Love this box fan! I have slept with fan noise since I was a teenager. The white noise helps me sleep. Now almost 40 years later my husband and I both sleep with fans. This box fan is the best for white noise. We LOVE it! It is lightweight and blows air also but the noise is the best. Very loud."
  },
  {
    "content": "I got one of these a few months ago but didn't need it till now. It is a disappointment. This is a lightweight plastic, noisy fan that does not move much air. In addition, most of the air movement seems to be along the lower side of the fan. Spend more and get a real fan. I would not recommend."
  },
  {
    "content": "I've always just bought the box fans from Walmart but the plastic stand pieces always fall off, which makes the fan lean or fall over frequently. Thus fan is only $12 more than the fan from Walmart and it is 10x better and the stand pieces are sturdy and built in to the fan. It also blows out cooler and stronger air. Definitely worth it!!"
  },
  {
    "content": "Used this to build a garage air filter and it works fine for that purpose. I suspect it would be a bit too noisy on full speed to use for room cooling."
  },
  {
    "content": "I purchased this and the Gensis 20 inch box fan at the same time. They are both the same fan being mass produced by some factory in China and each company just pays to have their logo on it. The instructions even use the same images. Get something more expensive."
  },
  {
    "content": "Would have been happy with this purchase in spite of the high price except for the fact that the fan inexplicably doesnt even turn on all the sudden after less than two full months."
  },
  {
    "content": "I was hoping to use it as a window fan in my bedroom, but it's too loud for sleeping to be feasible, even on the lowest setting. It also doesn't seem like it moves much air relative to how much noise it makes. Will be returning."
  },
  {
    "content": "I'm sorry to say that this fan did not satisfied my needs. On the other hand, if you needed it for a smaller space it would be the fan for you. Everything was good, just not powerful enough for the area I have."
  },
  {
    "content": "a lot of the reviews complain about how loud it is, that was the entire reason we got it. It is pretty loud when on High and is perfect for some white noise to drown out unwanted sounds when trying to sleep."
  },
  {
    "content": "This fan has been a lifesaver this summer. Extremely good value for the price, can’t beat this light, portable fan. The highest setting is a little loud, but very effective so it’s worth it. Easy enough to move from bedroom to living room or wherever you need it. Also I like that it’s thin enough to fit in the windowsill! Very satisfied with this purchase."
  },
  {
    "content": "You could attach this beast to an airplane and it would fly. Kind of loud but it's MOVES the air."
  },
  {
    "content": "This fan is one of the most quiet fans that I have ever purchased. It is very lightweight and easy to move around. Definitely worth some money, this was a decent price and I would purchase again."
  },
  {
    "content": "Use it to provide extra room ventilation because duct vent does not work good. daughter loves it cause its more silent than window ac unit."
  },
  {
    "content": "I just took it out of the box since it is hot now and it does not work. . .not even a sound. So I just went to get a return and they won't take it back. . . .waste of money and not a company of integrity."
  },
  {
    "content": "Love these fans! We purchased 2 to help cool down our house during the hot summer months., they are a little loud, but they circulate the air well and definitely helps the house feel cool."
  },
  {
    "content": "Blows air, works great, is perfectly loud enough for white noise when sleeping. I really like this fan. It is sturdy and my cats can't knock it over. It is a little on the loud side even on low, but I use a fan for white noise at night so this is fine by me."
  },
  {
    "content": "Super powerful fan with a very loud noise. With a little bit of an exaggeration, it really does sound like a jet engine. I live in a complex apartment so I'm a bit worried about the loud noise it makes. It is a great fan but I hope the range was more dynamic. I love the powerful 3rd mode but the 1st mode should be much quieter."
  },
  {
    "content": "I've used fans to help me sleep for as long as I can remember and usually after so many months or maybe even a year I'd find myself looking to replace the previous one because it either just isn't working as strong anymore or it completely stopped working but this fan is 100% worth every penny! It's perfect! It's quiet but forceful and still going strong! Highly recommend!"
  },
  {
    "content": "This fan is pretty great for a home office, but on days where all you want is a bit of air circulation, it’s lowest setting leaves a bit to be desired. It’s fairly noisy for a box fan and the lowest setting is comparable to the medium setting of other similarly sized units. Still, for those hot and humid days, I’m glad I made this purchase and might buy more in the near future."
  },
  {
    "content": "I bought 7 of them altogether. One of them had a piece of plastic part hanging inside the fan space which the fan hits when it spins. It makes a rather scary noise when the fan hits that hanging plastic part. Just bad quality control."
  },
  {
    "content": "I normally place my box fans in a window about 2 feet off the ground. Periodically they fall over from a gust of wind. This one fell over once nothing is visibly broken and will not work now. Just hums like its trying to spin up. Would not recommend."
  },
  {
    "content": "This fan is VERY, VERY loud. On setting 1 you can’t even hear people talking that are in the same room. I like a little white noise when I’m sleep, but this fan is far too loud, it keeps me from falling asleep. Currently shopping for a quieter one. I hate it."
  },
  {
    "content": "I bought this fan specifically for the noise and it did deliver! Great air flow as well. Narrow and perfect for windows. Light weight."
  },
  {
    "content": "It's quite loud, but it moves air better than any other fan similar to it that I've owned. If I could make any change to it, I'd give it an external handle on the top. The one build into one of the corners is awkward to carry it with."
  },
  {
    "content": "This is a well-made fan. It seems to put out at least roughly the stated CFM (not measured, just guessing compared to other box fans), and has a nice sound to it."
  },
  {
    "content": "Bought this for my dad who likes box fans opposed to AC air. It worked to keep him cool, he liked it. The black is a sharp color, looks good."
  },
  {
    "content": "This fan is economical, assembly was a breeze, and it gets it gets its job done. Just two issues for me (or should I say annoyances), it is slightly loud compared to my old fan that gave up on me last week and vibrates a lot during operation."
  },
  {
    "content": "Fan is a solid plastic, very well made. Good air flow as well. The legs are already attached you just twist them in place which was cool. Only con is the placement of the molded handle. I would prefer a top mounted handle but its fine."
  },
  {
    "content": "It's a standard box fan. Maybe it's the grumpy old man in me but shouldn't a standard box fan cost around $20? It's fairly solid. The knob seems decent. Moves air. Not excessively loud"
  },
  {
    "content": "I got this for my grandma and she opened it outside of the return window and let me know the fan was busted once she opened it. I can't return it since it is outside the return window and i just wasted money on a fan that does not work."
  },
  {
    "content": "I purchased the Pelonis 3-speed fan through Amazon on January 13, 2021. I used it about 6 hours a day and it worked fine. On October20, 2021 it just completely stopped working. I hope this company has at least a one year warranty on their product. I would think that a fan would certainly work longer than 9 months. I would not purchase this fan again."
  },
  {
    "content": "I kinda don’t care abt the noise or maneuverability because the blades were unbalanced and I left it on, wandered off, and when I wandered back about an hour later the blade was stuck in the grille and the motor was broken. Do not recommend, buy a nicer fan."
  },
  {
    "content": "Great fan but Amazon lies about delivery. One day shipping promise continues to be a joke. 6 days later I got my fans. Called and they say sorry....its the virus After 8 months of the virus...take down the one day promise...."
  },
  {
    "content": "Cheap plastic, no metal anywhere. Cheesy construction. I suppose it blows air, but gets extremely loud on the only setting that really works. High."
  },
  {
    "content": "I need a constant “white noise” at night to sleep well. The fan gives me that and added air circulation which is a plus!"
  },
  {
    "content": "Cant speak for longevity as I only used it a few times, but i can take it apart which is a huge plus. I turned it to 3 (highest setting) and it kept spinning faster and faster. Very high cfm output. The name still sucks but it works."
